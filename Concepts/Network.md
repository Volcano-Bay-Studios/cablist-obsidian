a network is a group of [[Totems]], [[Oscillostone]], and [[Superheated Sand]] that is directly connected to each other, allowing the sharing of [[Entropy]]

Networks have an [[Entropy]] capacity, and a current [[Entropy]]. Different blocks can store different amounts of [[Entropy]]
[[Superheated Sand]] can store a large amount of [[Entropy]] making it suitable for making [[Entropy]] storage

[[Entropy]] containing blocks will attempt to distribute entropy evenly across the entire network.
